# ProjetPersoAR

Here are the different informations that you have to know before going into this project :

The Vuforia Package is not included in the project because of its weight.
You might have to import it to make it work

The AR scene works with two image targets, 
The first one is the Oxygen (which is the audio source)
The second one is the Astronaut (Which is the wall that will occult the sound)
