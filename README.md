# ProjetPersoAR

Here are the different informations that you have to know before going into this project :

The Vuforia Package is not included in the project because of its weight.
You might have to import it to make it work

AR scene :
The AR scene works with two image targets, 
The first one is the Oxygen (which is the audio source)
The second one is the Astronaut (Which is the wall that will occult the sound)

No AR scene :
The differents UI has the name of the action written on them, but here is a quick explaining,
There is three button on the bottom of the screen :
The bottom top one turns on/off the sound
The bottom left one put or take away the obstacle
The bottom right one change the movement of the audio source

There is three sliders that will move the camera on the axis defined next to them.
The button right to these sliders will reset the camera position
